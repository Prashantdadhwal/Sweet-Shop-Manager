- Reviewed design patterns and best practices for full-stack applications

#### 2. **Backend Development (Express + TypeScript)**
- Generated Express server boilerplate and initial middleware setup
- Created authentication routes with JWT token generation and validation
- Built Drizzle ORM schema definitions for all database tables
- Generated CRUD API endpoints for sweets management
- Created validation logic using Zod schemas for input validation
- Implemented error handling middleware and response formatting
- Assisted with database connection setup and PostgreSQL configuration
- Debugged TypeScript type definitions and async/await patterns

#### 3. **Frontend Development (React + Vite)**
- Generated React component templates for pages (Login, Dashboard, Admin Panel)
- Created reusable UI components (Product Cards, Forms, Buttons, Modals)
- Built custom React hooks for API calls and state management
- Implemented React Hook Form integration for form validation
- Generated API client functions for communicating with backend
- Built product search and filter functionality
- Created admin dashboard components with tables and action buttons
- Implemented pagination and sorting logic

#### 4. **Database & ORM (Drizzle)**
- Designed Drizzle ORM schema for Users, Sweets, Orders, and Inventory tables
- Created relationships and foreign keys between tables
- Generated migration code for database initialization
- Assisted with complex queries for searching and filtering sweets
- Debugged database connection errors and PostgreSQL configuration
- Optimized query performance and added proper indexing

#### 5. **Styling & UI (Tailwind CSS + Radix UI)**
- Used Replit AI to suggest optimal Tailwind CSS class combinations
- Generated responsive layout utilities and breakpoints
- Built responsive grid layouts for product display
- Created dark mode implementation using next-themes
- Designed form styles with proper spacing and validation states
- Built card components, headers, and navigation bars
- Implemented hover effects, animations, and transitions
- Ensured mobile-first and fully responsive design

#### 6. **Authentication & Security**
- Generated JWT token creation and verification logic
- Built Passport.js local strategy configuration
- Created session management with express-session
- Implemented bcryptjs password hashing
- Generated protected route middleware
- Created role-based access control (User vs Admin)
- Assisted with CORS configuration and security headers

#### 7. **Testing & Debugging**
- Generated test case templates for API endpoints
- Helped debug TypeScript compilation errors
- Fixed authentication token validation issues
- Debugged React Hook Form validation problems
- Assisted with console error troubleshooting
- Optimized performance and fixed rendering issues
- Helped with database query debugging

### Reflection on AI Impact

**Positive Impact:**
- ⚡ **Speed & Productivity**: Accelerated development by 40-50%, especially for boilerplate and repetitive code
- 📚 **Learning**: Exposed me to modern patterns, best practices, and industry standards
- 🎯 **Focus**: AI handled routine tasks, allowing me to focus on business logic and features
- 💡 **Problem-Solving**: Quick solutions for debugging and overcoming technical blockers
- 📝 **Code Quality**: AI suggestions helped maintain consistent code style across the project
- 🔍 **Best Practices**: Learned security patterns, TypeScript best practices, and design patterns

**Challenges & Learnings:**
- 🔎 **Code Review Required**: Had to thoroughly review and test ALL AI-generated code before using it
- ⚠️ **Accuracy Varies**: AI sometimes suggested outdated patterns; required research to verify
- 🧠 **Critical Thinking Essential**: Complex business logic required manual implementation after AI scaffolding
- 🛠️ **Debugging Needed**: Generated code sometimes had bugs; had to test and fix issues
- 📊 **Context**: AI sometimes missed project context; had to guide it with detailed prompts

**Overall Assessment:**
AI tools significantly improved my development workflow by handling repetitive boilerplate and offering quick solutions. However, critical thinking, testing, and manual refinement were essential for production-ready code. I view AI as a powerful co-pilot that amplifies productivity when used responsibly.
